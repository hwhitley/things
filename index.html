    <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <p>Hello people. This website is about my life and hobbies! That is me in the orange jacket!</p>
        <img alt="A picture of me" src="me.jpg" class="responsive"/>
        
            <p>I was born in 1998 in Colonial Heights, Virginia. I have one sister named Paige, a dog named Reese, and a cat named Orange Cat. I received my B.A. from <a href="https://vt.edu/"> Virginia Tech</a> in May 2020 and now I am pursuing my Master's in Communication. I am Dr. Horning's research assistant working on his <strong>News Transparency Project</strong>.
        <p>I used to be a basketball manager at Virginia Tech, but then I moved to a position with the football team! Specifically, I work with the quarterbacks and assist with practice everyday. I really enjoy being on the field for games!</p>
