        <p>I have enjoyed sports since I was little! I started playing football at an early age, but quickly fell in love with basketball before I even started kindergarten! I played multiple sports throughout school, and though I wasn't the best player, I enjoyed being on the field and court with my teammates! I think sports are fun because they allow me to be active and they fulfill my competitiveness. My favorite sports teams are <a href="https://vt.edu/"> Virginia Tech</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics"> Boston Celtics</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox"> Boston Red Sox</a>.</p>
